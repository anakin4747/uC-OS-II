There are 4 states of Tasks in uc/OS-II

Only the kernel can move tasks between states via a kernel service call.
When a service call is made by the task that is running or by an ISR, the
kernel's scheduler gets executed.

DORMANT
    All start out as dormant and the kernel will not be managed by the kernel.
    In this state the code for the task is written and has stack space
    allocated for it. These tasks will not be scheduled to run.
    To exit the dormant state OSTaskCreate() must be run on that task.
    This places the task in the READY state.
    OSTaskDel() will return the state back to dormant from any other state.

READY
    A task can be considered ready after an event posted or the task resumed.
    This means it will get switched into running when it is scheduled. A ready
    task can be sent to waiting from ready if it is suspended. The scheduler
    always switches CPU control to the highest priority task in the READY state.

WAITING
    
RUNNING
